# States-Analysis-
Python Visualization Project

The project is designed to analyze, visualize, and present insights from a dataset related to states using Python libraries. The project encompasses data loading, cohort analysis, and the creation of interactive visualizations and a dashboard. Initially, the dataset is loaded from a CSV file, followed by data cleaning to remove duplicates and null values. Cohort analysis is performed, investigating average population density and literacy rates for specific years. Visualizations include a Matplotlib plot illustrating cohort analysis trends and several Plotly Express figures such as a bar plot showing population by state, a scatter plot depicting the relationship between population density and literacy rate, a histogram of urban population distribution, and a box plot of sex ratio variations by year. The centerpiece is an interactive web dashboard created using Dash, where users can explore these visualizations. The pre-requisites for this project include knowledge of Python programming, familiarity with libraries like pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, and Dash, as well as a dataset (STATES.csv) containing relevant state-related data.
